The makefile will compile all three programs with 'make' to program1, program2, and program3.

An additional makefile target can be ran with 'make run' to execute the three programs in the following fashion:
./program1 filex.txt filey.txt output1.txt
./program2 filex.txt filey.txt output2.txt
./program3 filex.txt filey.txt output3.txt
